# Advent of Code 2024 solutions

I'm not going to pretend these are amazing solutions but hopefully by the time
I commit them they work.

Each day contains a main class named `uk.zootm.aoc2024.dayn.DayN` and the input
file (where there's just one) is stored in the resources for the same package,
named `input`. These are filtered out per
[AOC's guidance on redistribution](redist).
